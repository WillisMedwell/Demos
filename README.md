# Willis' Demos
This repository contains a collection of projects that I have ported to the web. Using the Wasi-SDK toolchain, I have been able to compile modern C++ code to WebAssembly (WASM), thus overcoming the typical portability challenges faced by C++.

## Ray Tracer
- Language: C
- Purpose: This project was aimed at introducing myself to graphics programming and refreshing my knowledge of linear algebra in preparation for an upcoming university unit.
- TODO: Implement features such as Lambert lighting, SIMD optimizations, diffuse and reflective materials, and more.

## Astar Algorithm
- Language: C++
- Purpose: As part of a recent OOP class project, I implemented the A* algorithm. However, I was interested in exploring how I could further enhance its performance.
- TODO: Implement a user interface to enable easy interaction with the algorithm.

## Worley Noise
- Language: C++
- Purpose: This project focuses on generating Worley noise, a type of procedural noise commonly used in computer graphics.
- TODO: Optimize the algorithm using a quadtree data structure to avoid performing nÂ² comparisons.

Feel free to explore the code and run the demos provided. Contributions and improvements are always welcome!
