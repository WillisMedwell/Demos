# Willis' Demos
This repository contains a collection of projects that I have ported to the web. Using the Wasi-SDK toolchain, I have been able to compile modern C++ code to WebAssembly (WASM), thus overcoming the typical portability challenges faced by C++.

## Live Demo!
Have a look [here!](https://willismedwell.github.io/Demos/index.html)

## Ray Tracer
- Language: C
- Purpose: This project was aimed at introducing myself to graphics programming and refreshing my knowledge of linear algebra in preparation for an upcoming university unit.
- TODO: Implement features such as Lambert lighting, SIMD optimizations, diffuse and reflective materials, and more.

## Worley Noise
**TODO**
- Language: C++
- Purpose: This project focuses on generating Worley noise, a type of procedural noise commonly used in computer graphics.
- TODO: Optimize the algorithm using a quadtree data structure to avoid performing nÂ² comparisons.
